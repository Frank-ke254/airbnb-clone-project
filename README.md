# airbnb-clone-project Overview.
# Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. 
# It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. 
# This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Team roles:
# UI/UX designers: They design how the user interface looks and the flow between various pages.
# Business analyst: Translates customer business needs into requirements.
# Product owner: Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements.
# Project manager: Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget.
# Software architect: Designs a high-level software architecture, selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision and sets up code quality standards and performs       code reviews.
# Software developer: turn the design to a working system through code.
# Quality Assuarance Engineer: Makes sure an application performs according to requirements.

# Technology Stack:
# Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
# Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
# PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
# GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
# Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
# Redis: Used for caching and session management.
# Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
# CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design:
# Users : userId, name, email, password, phone number etc.
# Properties: propertyId, userId, propertyName, Price etc.
# Bookings: bookingId, userId, date, status etc.
# Payments: paymentId, userId, method, status.
# Reviews: reviewId, userId, propertyId, rating, reviewMessage.

# Feature Breakdown:
# User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
# Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
# Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
# Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
# Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
# Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

# API Security:
# Authentication and Authorization: ensure users access only what they are signed up for.
# Data protection: prevent sensitive data from access by unauthorized personnels. 
# Request and Traffic control: rate limiting - prevent abuse such as Denial of Service attacks.
# Input validation: sanitize inputs to avoid SQL and command injections.

# CI/CD Pipeline:
# CI stands for Continuous Integration which helps developers to merge code changes frequently in shared repos.
# It ensures code in main branch is buildable and testable.
# CD stands for Continuous Deployment which is used to extend CI by automatically preparing builds for release.
# It helps by ensuring that every passing build or test is pushed live with no manual intervention.
# Tools include: GitHub Actions, BitBucket Pipelines, Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS CodePipeeline, AgroCD,
